I'm Laimis JuzeliÅ«nas - SRE/DevOps/Infrastructure engineer. I take care of large scale platform builds, do my best to create a self healing infrastructure and enhance overall development experience.  
On my free time I like to contribute back to the open-source community with whatever I find and however I can.
